# flask_poc
Its a poc to understand the base structure on what we can do with flask.

Here, we create a basic flask app, with ability to say hello world on base page. 
- We can also run page_address + "/person/", to get a jsonified view of person information we provide.
- Also, we can get a sequence of numbers as a json with page_address + "/numbers/".

The above routes created only for POC purpose. Flask can serve a much larger purpose.
